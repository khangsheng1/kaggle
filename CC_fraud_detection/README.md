# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

This repository contains the code and analysis for a credit card fraud detection project using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project can be found [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023).

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using various machine learning models. The dataset includes a mix of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, and the aim is to create a model that can accurately classify these transactions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (2023), available on Kaggle. It contains several anonymized features along with a class label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Python 3 installed along with the following packages:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
